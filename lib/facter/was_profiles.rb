## Facts for IBM WebSphere Application Server

## Facts:
##   websphere_profiles
##     A comma-separated list of all WAS 'profiles' on a system
##   websphere_$profile_version
##     The WAS version reported by a profile via versionInfo.sh
##   websphere_$profile_$cell_soap
##     The SOAP port for a profile cell.  Needed for federation.
##
## TODO: clean this up.  Someone that's better with Ruby than me needs to
## look at it.

## Iterate over each instance that's listed in the "facts.d" fact to determine
## its version.  This is hacky, but we're relying on arbitrary user-provided
## install locations.  That's recorded in that 'facts.d' fact during
## installation time, and I can't think of a more accurate way of obtaining
## that - again - it's user-provided and arbitrary.
## We want the version and package name.  We'll be able to use this for
## installing IBM "fix packs"
##
## There is a chance that they'll have two instances with the same name, but
## different install paths.  If that's the case, this just isn't going to work
## as expected.
